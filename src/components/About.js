              Born in Shanghai, I moved to London as a teenager and then graduated from the London School of Economics with a BSc and an MSc, studying mathematics, economics, and finance. I now work at KPMG in London, focusing on technology-driven projects.

              I love exploring new cuisines, from trendy hotspots to hidden gems tucked away in local neighbourhoods. I also run regularly along the Thames, watching Tower Bridge through all four seasons and how the river changes with time and light.

              Outside of work, I like to code just for fun. This website is one of my personal projects â€” a space to capture the small moments of my twenties, memories that will only grow more precious with time.
